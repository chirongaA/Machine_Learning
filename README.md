# Machine_Learning
A compilation of some of the Machine Learning projects and assignments that I have worked on

## Income assignment

This mini-project was given to explore how different models classify a dataset that was given (INCOME.CSV).

The 4 models used were: Naive-Bayes, k-NN, Decision Trees and Random Forest. But before using these models, it was crucial to clean the data. Data cleaning is a crucial step in Machine Learning where we get rid of unusable, missing or irrelevant data.

After modelling and training, it was found that k-NN and Naive-Bayes had the highest accuracy in classifying the data givenðŸ˜®. Theoretically, Random Forest should have had the highest accuracy but the other two aforementioned models performed better likely due to its strong assumptions on feature independence.

As a start, this was a really cool project in opening the doors to Machine Learning. However, future work should explore more advanced techinques in redefining hyperparameters better so as to get more acuurate sccores

## Tic-Tac-Toe

Takes me back to my childhood; playing tic-tac-toe as the teacher was scribbling on the boardðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜‚
I then got the chance to implement a program where this legend of a game could be played on a computer.

There are two parts to the code: tictactoe.py and main.py:
1. tictactoe.py- Minimax-Based
   This was an implementation of the minimax algorithm for an AI opponent that takes O. The game starts with a       human (X) playing against the AI. The AI evaluates all pssible future moves and selects the optimal move.
2. main.py- Two-Player Tic-Tac-Toe
   This is a "control" program that simulates the normal human vs human version of the game.
