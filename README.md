# Machine_Learning
A compilation of some of the Machine Learning projects and assignments that I have worked on

Income assignment

This mini-project was given to explore how different models classify a dataset that was given (INCOME.CSV).

The 4 models used were: Naive-Bayes, k-NN, Decision Trees and Random Forest. But before using these models, it was crucial to clean the data. Data cleaning is a crucial step in Machine Learning where we get rid of unusable, missing or irrelevant data.

After modelling and training, it was found that k-NN and Naive-Bayes had the highest accuracy in classifying the data givenðŸ˜®. Theoretically, Random Forest should have had the highest accuracy but the other two aforementioned models performed better likely due to its strong assumptions on feature independence.

As a start, this was a really cool project in opening the doors to Machine Learning. However, future work should explore more advanced techinques in redefining hyperparameters better so as to get more acuurate sccores
